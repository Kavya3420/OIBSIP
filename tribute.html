    <h1>Tribute to Mahatma Gandhi</h1>

    <p>
      Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi or Bapu,
      was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule.
      He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India.
      Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence and civil disobedience played a crucial role
      in India's struggle for independence.
    </p>
    <p>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, 
      Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, 
      and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, 
      where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa 
      in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. 
      He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. </p>
    <h2>Early life and background</h2>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[3][4] was born on 2 October 1869[5] into a Gujarati Hindu Modh 
        Bania family[6][7] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar 
        Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of 
        the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan 
        (chief minister) of Porbandar state.
        His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.</p>
      <h4>Some of the Interesting facts of Gandhi!!!</h4>
      <h3><i>1. His name wasn’t MahatmaGandhi’s first name was Mohandas:</i></h3>
      <p>‘Mahatma’ is a title denoting love and respect, which roughly translates
           as ‘great soul’. It’s thought that a friend of his, Pranjivan Mehta, was the first to refer 
          to Gandhi as ‘Mahatma’ in writing, in a letter from 1909. That was decades before he became a figure of global renown.</p>
      <h3><i>2. He got married at thirteen</i></h3>
      <p>In 1883, thirteen-year-old Gandhi tied the knot with fourteen-year-old Kasturbai 
            Kapadia in an arranged marriage. ‘As we didn't know much about marriage, 
            for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives,’ 
            Gandhi later recalled. He fathered his first child aged just sixteen, but the baby only lived a few days. 
            The couple went on to have four more children who survived to adulthood.</p>
      <h3><i>3. He first became a civil rights activist in South Africa</i></h3>
      <p>Gandhi is synonymous with the struggle for Indian independence, but he first became a 
              civil rights crusader in South Africa. Arriving in 1893 to work as a law clerk at an Indian firm, 
              he experienced such everyday racism – including being ejected from a first-class train carriage 
              despite having a ticket – that he decided to fight what he called ‘the deep disease of colour prejudice’. 
              He founded an organisation to tackle discrimination and was once attacked and nearly killed by a white mob in Durban.</p>
      <h3><i>4. He helped the British Empire</i></h3>
      <p>Despite his disaffection with racist colonialist attitudes, the young Gandhi also felt patriotic 
                towards the British Empire. During the Boer War of 1899-1902, he took it upon himself to form the
                 Natal Indian Ambulance Corps, gathering hundreds of volunteers to whisk wounded British 
                 troops from the front lines to field hospitals.‘I felt that, if I demanded rights as a British citizen, 
                 it was also my duty, as such, to participate in the defence of the British Empire,’ Gandhi later said.</p>
      <h3><i>5. He never won the Nobel Peace Prize</i></h3> 
      <p>Gandhi was first shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1937, but the Nobel committee’s advisor was sceptical, 
                saying that even though Gandhi was non-violent, his Indian nationalist beliefs spurred violence among followers. 
                Gandhi was shortlisted a second time in 1947, but again he was rejected for his nationalism. He was killed in 1948, 
                sand – significantly – no Nobel Peace Prize was awarded that year.</p>
